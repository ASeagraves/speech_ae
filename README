This package implements autoencoders for processing speech data.  

Contents:

build_speech_dict.py
-Driver to build a speech_dict ("speech dictionary") from a LibriSpeech corpus.  The speech_dict data structure forms the basis for the DataGenerator class implemented in generator.py.

utilities.py
-A set of utility functions for preprocessing a LibriSpeech corpus including speech_dict construction.

generator.py
-DataGenerator class for generating batches of speech audio sequences from a preprocessed LibriSpeech corpus.

main.py
-Keras implementation of a vanilla autoencoder using fully-connected layers built using Sequential()
